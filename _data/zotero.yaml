  abstract: >-
    In Syria, interfaith dialogue constitutes a public practice that speaks to
    ethical, social and political imaginaries. As an official practice, it helps
    to provide the regime with religious legitimacy, though unofficially it
    often functions as a euphemism for missionary efforts. On a more abstract
    level, a careful analysis of Syrian interfaith dialogue reveals that
    different ethical traditions inform the participants' vision of "good." The
    Muslim sheikhs in this case-study follow an Aristotelian model of ethics
    that presupposes pious individuals for the creation and preservation of a
    moral society. Accordingly, they aim at fostering inter-communal harmony by
    teaching people how to perform virtues, rather than teaching them about
    other religions. Conversely, the Christian priests share a model that
    combines post-Enlightenment rationalism with "Christian love," and thus they
    strive to advance tolerance by encouraging unconditional affection,
    intellectual and experiential awareness of others. Together, these
    discrepancies facilitate miscommunication among the participants of
    dialogue.

    The triad of Jews, Gentiles and Christians seems clearly arranged in the
    religious
     world of the Roman Empire. However, a closer look shows that this is too simple a
     model in that it neither does justice to the diverse descriptions of these groups
     or those of others, nor to their respective concepts of identity or the varying mechanisms
     of inclusions and exclusions. This volume illustrates this by way of interdisciplinary
     individual studies on Asia Minor, but also through conceptional considerations. In
     summary, the editors offer new terminology suggestions

  abstract: >-
    Dutch society is highly secularized in terms of decreasing church membership
    and church attendance. Meanwhile, there are many ‘religious creatives’ who
    fulfil their need for meaning by using multiple religious sources. This
    paper presents an empirical investigation into the occurrence and nature of
    hybrid religion in the Netherlands, seen as ‘multiple religious belonging’
    (MRB). After a number of global indications of the importance of MRB, this
    is the first attempt to quantify and detail MRB in a population. A new
    approach to ‘religious belonging’ is developed, not in an exclusive,
    ‘property’ sense, but in terms of being related and feeling at home. This
    approach leads to a number of ‘modalities of belonging’, that can be
    measured per religion. To do so, a survey among a representative sample of
    the Dutch population was used. The survey results indicate that MRB is
    present among at least 23% of the population in varying combinations and
    intensities. They also highlight the tendency to emphasize the relatedness
    between religions, and the permeability and even blurring of the boundaries
    between them

  abstract: >-
    This paper critically examines the notion of ‘multiple religious belonging’
    (MRB). Through an analysis of a recent study by Joantine Berghuijs, it
    argues that MRB is ill-defined and exaggerates the extent of popular
    religiosity. If MRB is at all common, then the de-legitimating effect of
    religious pluralism (which is well-supported by the evidence) is challenged.
    This paper suggests that such a challenge is unwarranted by Berghuijs’s
    evidence and concludes with an elaboration of the various and very different
    things that might be encompassed by MRB.

  abstract: >-
    "The History of the 'Slave of Christ' : From Jewish Child to Christian
    Martyr offers the first critical editions and English translations of the
    two Syriac recensions of this fascinating text, which narrates the story of
    a young Jewish child, Asher, who after converting to Christianity and taking
    the name ʻAbda da-Miḥa ('slave of Christ') is martyred by his father Levi in
    a scene reminiscent of Abraham's offering of Isaac in Genesis 22. In a
    detailed introduction, the authors argue that the text is a fictional story
    composed during the early Islamic period (ca. 650-850) probably in Shigar
    (modern Sinjār). Building upon methodology from the study of Western
    Christian and Jewish texts, they further contend that the story's author
    constructs an imagined Jew based on the Hebrew Bible, thereby challenging
    the way that previous scholars have used this text as straightforward
    evidence for historical interactions between Jews and Christians in
    Babylonia at this time. This ultimately allows the authors to reevaluate the
    purpose of the text and to situate it in its Late Antique Babylonian
    context"--

    In this article, we review the psychology of religion and radicalization. In
    doing so, we note that both macro-level approaches (that study structural
    conditions in society) and micro-level approaches (that focus on
    psychological coping and personal appraisal of individual conditions) fail
    to adequately explain radical behavior of members of extreme religious
    groups. Instead, we propose that meso-level approaches best explain
    religious radicalization. These meso-level approaches explain how members of
    extreme religious groups appraise societal conditions and find redemption in
    radical beliefs. In particular, we argue for a more in-depth examination of
    the historical and societal contexts in which various radicalization
    processes take place and narratives of radical redemption hold sway.

  abstract: >-
    Christian syncretism is but a surface aspect of voodoo, the Haitian folk
    religion that has two major African sources. The rada cult comes from
    Dahomey whereas the petro cult, which is usually said to be Creole, has its
    roots among the Kongo. This twofold contribution is analysed from structural
    and historical viewpoints. The petro divinities are associated with fire and
    magic, even witchcraft; their rites sometimes require that the most dreadful
    of them be `attached' or `chained' to pieces of wood. Certain rada
    divinities, beneficial and peaceful, have violent congeners in the petro
    pantheon. Each cult has distinct altars in the temple. Near Gonaives in
    northern Haiti is a temple devoted to the worship of purely Kongo
    divinities, who are placed under the authority of a king and queen that
    remind us of the Kingo kingdom. Both structural and historical perspectives
    are needed for a full under-standing of syncretism.

  abstract: >-
    Vodou, the folk religion of Haiti, is a by-product of the contact between
    Roman Catholicism and African and Amerindian traditional religions. In this
    book, Leslie Desmangles analyzes the mythology and rituals of Vodou,
    focusing particularly on the inclusion of West African and European elements
    in Vodouisants' beliefs and practices.Desmangles sees Vodou not simply as a
    grafting of European religious traditions onto African stock, but as a true
    creole phenomenon, born out of the oppressive conditions of slavery and the
    necessary adaptation of slaves to a New World environment.Desmangles uses
    Haitian history to explain this phenomenon, paying particular attention to
    the role of the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century maroon communities in
    preserving African traditions and the attempts by the Catholic, educated
    elite to suppress African-based "superstitions." The result is a society in
    which one religion, Catholicism, is visible and official; the other, Vodou,
    is unofficial and largely secretive.

  abstract: >-
    It is argued that the concept of Multiple Religious Belonging as normally
    conceived relies upon a problematic construction of “religion” which can be
    expressed as the World Religions Paradigm. This relies upon a modern Western
    Protestant bias as to how “religion” should be understood. It is argued that
    religion can be understood otherwise, and looking at the Chinese context an
    argument is made that participation in different religious traditions relies
    upon a very different construct from Multiple Religious Belonging via the
    World Religions Paradigm model. This is termed Strategic Religious
    Participation in a Shared Religious Landscape. It considers the way that
    Chinese religiosity does not have fixed borders in the same way as the World
    Religions Paradigm suggests. Indeed, asking whether there is Multiple
    Religious Belonging in traditional Chinese thought seems to misconstrue the
    situation. A final reflection asks whether this new paradigm, of Strategic
    Religious Participation in a Shared Religious Landscape, may be appropriate
    to look at the contemporary Western context amongst a number of religious
    “nones”. Although no definitive answer is given to this question, the issue
    highlights that the World Religions Paradigm which shapes our sense of
    Multiple Religious Belonging may need to be rethought within different
    contexts.

  abstract: >-
    The essay examines the model case, the stateless Jewish diaspora, and asks
    why a dispersed powerful people like “the” Romans is not analyzed as
    diaspora. Do people, who establish institutions of rule far from their core
    and mythical place of origin, Rome in Italy in this case, and who impose
    their power, not form diasporas? Other ethnic, professional, and religious
    groups established diasporic connectivity: the Normans, men and women of
    Christian faith, Indian Ocean merchants as well as, from mid-15th century
    the Southeast Asian “Chinese” It is argued that specific socio-economic
    rather than ethno-cultural groups from specific locations form translocal
    rather than transnational communities and engage in cultural transformations
    along the routes.

  abstract: >-
    "Although ethnic and sectarian tensions have always been a feature of modern
    Indian history, the country was founded and governed in its first decades by
    a nationalist political movement - associated with the Indian National
    Congress -- that stressed the non-sectarian nature of Indian citizenship.
    Hindu nationalism, a contrary political force, was born in the 1920s but
    didn't take off politically until the 1990s. It finally secured national
    power in 2014 when a populist leader, Narendra Modi -- a former governor of
    the province of Gujarat -- leveraged a reputation for successful economic
    reform and popular resentment toward the country's Muslim minority to lead
    his Hindu nationalist party, the BJP, to national victory. In this book,
    Christophe Jaffrelot recounts how the Hindu nationalist movement under the
    leadership of Modi's BJP has deeply transformed the country. Jaffrelot's
    main argument is that the reign of Modi and his BJP has ushered India into a
    new type of regime - what he calls ethnic democracy. Modi's rule relies
    undeniably on popular consent. (In last month's Indian federal elections,
    Modi consolidated his 2014 win with a decisive electoral victory.) But under
    the BJP India has largely jettisoned the country's previous commitment to
    the preservation of the rights of religious and ethnic minorities. This book
    is based both on the author's long years of research in India and on recent
    extensive interviews conducted across the country with civil servants,
    government supporters, opponents of the BJP, and members of religious
    minorities. Because of the tense atmosphere of intimidation throughout the
    country, many of Jaffrelot's interlocuters refused to speak on the record;
    he has given them pseudonyms in this book. The book recounts how proponents
    of secularism and pluralism, including academics and NGO workers, have been
    brought to heel; how Christians and Muslims have been increasingly
    marginalized in national and regional elections; and how the Hindu
    nationalist government has fostered the development of a shadow "cultural
    police force" -- with formal and informal ties to the state -- that censors
    public speech and intimidates political opponents. The book begins with an
    overview political history of modern India, explaining how the modern Indian
    state arose out of the heritage of British colonialism and then out of the
    Indian Congress-led national liberation movement. The bulk of the book takes
    up the rise and the rule of Hindu nationalism - Hindutva - and that of the
    strongman Modi, whose canny brand of populism has proven to be a game
    changer"--

  abstract: >-
    Violence has always played a part in the religious imagination, from symbols
    and myths to legendary battles, from colossal wars to the theater of
    terrorism. The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Violence surveys
    intersections between religion and violence throughout history and around
    the world. The forty original essays in this volume include overviews of
    major religious traditions, showing how violence is justified within the
    literary and theological foundations of the tradition, how it is used
    symbolically and in ritual practice, and how social acts of violence and
    warfare have been justified by religious ideas. The essays also examine
    patterns and themes relating to religious violence, such as sacrifice and
    martyrdom, which are explored in cross-disciplinary or regional analyses;
    and offer major analytic approaches, from literary to social scientific
    studies. The contributors to this volume--innovative thinkers who are
    forging new directions in theory and analysis related to religion and
    violence--provide novel insights into this important field of studies. By
    mapping out the whole field of religion and violence, The Oxford Handbook of
    Religion and Violence will prove an authoritative source for students and
    scholars for years to come.

  abstract: >-
    The phenomenon of multiple religious belonging is studied from different
    perspectives, each of which reveals a different understanding of religion,
    religious diversity and religious belonging. This shows that the phenomenon
    of multiple religious belonging is challenging the applicability of these
    central notions in academic enquiry about religion. In this article, I
    present the different perspectives on multiple religious belonging in
    theology of religions and show how the understanding of some central
    scholarly notions is different. In Christian theology, the debate on
    multiple religious belonging is conducted between particularists, who focus
    on the uniqueness of religious traditions, and pluralists, who focus on the
    shared religious core of religious traditions. Both positions are criticized
    by feminist and post-colonial theologians. They believe that both
    particularists and pluralists focus too strongly on religious traditions and
    the boundaries between them. I argue that the hermeneutic study of multiple
    religious belonging could benefit from a more open understanding of
    religious traditions and religious boundaries, as proposed by these feminist
    and post-colonial scholars. In order to achieve this goal we could also
    benefit from a more intercultural approach to multiple religious belonging
    in order to understand religious belonging in a nonexclusive way.

  abstract: >-
    The past several decades witnessed a renewed scholarly interest in diverse
    forms of Hinduism as so-called “missionary religions.” Referring to Hindu
    movements as “missionary,” of course, raises the question of conversion. Do
    these movements aim to convert others to their own teachings, or do they
    not? This chapter explores the theology of conversion that emerges from one
    strand of missionary Hinduism: the non-dualist tradition of Advaita Vedānta.
    The first section offers a brief survey of several theological and
    social-scientific treatments of conversion as a cross-cultural phenomenon.
    Two subsequent sections develop an outline of conversion in these
    traditions, rooted in various conversion narratives and in the teachings of
    such prominent Vedānta missionaries as Swami Vivekananda (1863–1902) and
    Swami Chinmayananda (1916–1993). From this analysis, the chapter argues that
    missionary Advaita does advance a specific understanding of conversion,
    albeit one that proceeds by the gradual transformation and perfection of
    rival religious views rather than their explicit exclusion. The result is a
    form of religious belonging that is neither exclusive nor multiple, but
    non-dual.

    How can we grasp the complex religious lives of individuals such as Peter,
    an ordained Protestant minister who has little attachment to any church but
    centers his highly committed religious practice on peace-and-justice
    activism? Or Hannah, a devout Jew whose rich spiritual life revolves around
    her women's spirituality group and the daily practice of meditative dance?
    Or Laura, who identifies as Catholic but rarely attends Mass, and engages
    daily in Buddhist-style meditation at her home altar arranged with symbols
    of Mexican American popular religion? Diverse religious practices such as
    these have long baffled scholars, whose research often starts with the
    assumption that individuals commit, or refuse to commit, to an entire
    institutionally framed package of beliefs and practices.Meredith McGuire
    points the way forward toward a new way of understanding religion. She
    argues that scholars must study religion not as it is defined by religious
    organizations, but as it is actually lived in people's everyday lives.
    Drawing on her own extensive fieldwork, as well as recent work by others,
    McGuire explores the many, seemingly mundane, ways that individuals practice
    their religions and develop their spiritual lives. By examining the many
    eclectic and creative practices -- of body, mind, emotion, and spirit --
    that have been invisible to researchers, she offers a fuller and more
    nuanced understanding of contemporary religion.

    Multiple religious belonging, also known as double belonging, refers to the
    idea that individuals can belong to more than one religious tradition. While
    this is often seen as a common reality in regions such as Asia with its many
    religions, religious scholars have begun to discuss multiple religion
    belonging with respect to religious traditions such as Judaism,
    Christianity, and Islam.Those who practice double belonging claim to be an
    adherent of two different religions at the same time or incorporate the
    practices of another religion into their own faith life. It is increasing
    with globalisation. One such example is a person attending a Christian
    church but also finding meaning in yoga and in forms of meditation inspired
    by Eastern traditions, and enjoying attending a Jewish Seder at Passover.

    Interfaith dialogue is commonly used in building peace and understanding
    among religious groups. Such a project, however, is only significant if it
    is not only executed by religious leaders and scholars, but also involves
    lay people at the grassroots level. In this article, I present findings of
    my fieldwork in a small village in East Java, Indonesia where land authority
    problems became a common ground for conducting interfaith cooperation. I
    observed interfaith empowerment efforts led by a group of Catholic activists
    and students who arrived in 1997, which successfully supported the villagers
    in claiming their land. According to Knitter (1995), grassroots interfaith
    cooperation will necessarily be followed by interfaith dialogue. My general
    finding is that in communities that have a lack of knowledge of their own
    particular religions, subsequent dialogue may take other forms which are
    different from that of Knitter's description.

    The Sikh religion has a following of over 20 million people worldwide.
    However,events such as the verbal and physical attacks on Sikhs just after
    September 11, where Sikhs were being mistaken for Muslims, suggest that the
    Sikh faith still remains mysterious to many. This Very Short Introduction
    introduces newcomers to the meaning of the Sikh religious tradition, its
    teachings, practices, rituals and festivals. Eleanor Nesbitt highlights and
    contextualizes the key threads in the history of Sikhism, from the first
    Gurus to martyrdom, militarization, and the increasingly significant
    diaspora. Examining gender, caste, and the changes that are currently
    underway in the faith, Nesbitt considers contemporary Sikh identities and
    their role in our world. ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions
    series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost
    every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get
    ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis,
    perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging
    topics highly readable.

    This entry surveys Sikhism in the context of the ethnography of Sikh
    communities in India and other countries. Attention is paid to issues of
    definition, core Sikh beliefs, the evolution of Sikh communities, and the
    formation of Sikh identity. The complex issues of caste and gender are
    considered, and briefer mention is made of time and place. The internet's
    role in Sikh representation and transnational Sikh community formation is
    noted, together with orientalism's contribution to the emergence of Sikhism
    as a “world religion.”

    The contribution of monks to the evangelization of lands not yet reached by
    the preaching of the Gospel has certainly been remarkable. The specific
    witness that the monastic community gives is of a radical Christian life
    naturally radiating outward, and thus it is implicitly missionary. The
    process of inculturation of Christian monasticism in China required a bold
    spiritual attitude of openness to the future and a willingness to accept the
    transformation of monastic forms that had been received. In Christian Monks
    on Chinese Soil, Matteo Nicolini-Zani highlights the willingness of foreign
    monks to encounter the cultural and spiritual realities of China and the
    degree of acceptance by the Chinese of the form of monastic life that was
    presented to them by the missionaries.

    The phenomenon of multiple religious belonging is studied from different
    perspectives, each of which reveals a different understanding of religion,
    religious diversity and religious belonging. This shows that the phenomenon
    of multiple religious belonging is challenging the applicability of these
    central notions in academic enquiry about religion. In this article, I
    present the different perspectives on multiple religious belonging in
    theology of religions and show how the understanding of some central
    scholarly notions is different. In Christian theology, the debate on
    multiple religious belonging is conducted between particularists, who focus
    on the uniqueness of religious traditions, and pluralists, who focus on the
    shared religious core of religious traditions. Both positions are criticized
    by feminist and post-colonial theologians. They believe that both
    particularists and pluralists focus too strongly on religious traditions and
    the boundaries between them. I argue that the hermeneutic study of multiple
    religious belonging could benefit from a more open understanding of
    religious traditions and religious boundaries, as proposed by these feminist
    and post-colonial scholars. In order to achieve this goal we could also
    benefit from a more intercultural approach to multiple religious belonging
    in order to understand religious belonging in a nonexclusive way.

    Interfaith dialogue is increasingly being recognised by governments across
    Europe as crucial to developing cohesive communities. This article
    critically analyses approaches for developing strategies to promote
    interfaith dialogue between individuals and/or organisations within civil
    society. It does this by drawing on a series of theoretical questions
    concerning those who are involved (and missing), what the dialogue is for,
    and how the dynamics of participation and representation are handled. In the
    process, the article considers the conditions, spaces, processes,
    relationships and understandings of identity that can enable successful
    interfaith dialogue, and how these might be developed in ways which address
    the issues raised. The original theoretical analysis presented in this
    article is supported by examples from the author’s cumulative research with
    policymakers and practitioners across Europe since 2004.

    The papers in this volume were presented at a Mellon-Sawyer Seminar held at
    the University of Oxford in 2009-2010, which sought to investigate side by
    side the two important movements of conversion that frame late antiquity: to
    Christianity at its start, and to Islam at the other end. Challenging the
    opposition between the two stereotypes of Islamic conversion as an
    intrinsically violent process, and Christian conversion as a fundamentally
    spiritual one, the papers seek to isolate the behaviours and circumstances
    that made conversion both such a common and such a contested phenomenon. The
    spread of Buddhism in Asia in broadly the same period serves as an external
    comparator that was not caught in the net of the Abrahamic religions. The
    volume is organised around several themes, reflecting the concerns of the
    initial project with the articulation between norm and practice, the role of
    authorities and institutions, and the social and individual fluidity on the
    ground

    The majority of Europe’s Christians are non-practicing, but they differ from
    religiously unaffiliated people in their views on God, attitudes toward
    Muslims and immigrants, and opinions about religion’s role in society.

  abstract: >-
    Our understanding and perceptions of the conquest period in Latin American
    history have been profoundly altered by the scholarship of the past twenty
    years. The traditional triumphalist narrative of the Spanish Conquest
    focused heavily on the conquistadors in Mexico and Peru, and emphasized the
    inevitability and rapidity of military victory, religious conversion (the
    Spiritual Conquest), and colonization. The revisionist New Conquest History
    – which emerged in part from a renewed emphasis on archival and paleographic
    work and in part from the New Philology, a school of scholarship based on
    the analysis of colonial-period primary sources in Mesoamerican languages –
    complicates that narrative by emphasizing multiple protagonists and
    accounts, new source materials, the roles and interpretations of indigenous
    and black men and women, and the examination of understudied regions of the
    Americas.

  abstract: >-
    Female Power and Religious Change in the Medieval Near East engages with two
    levels of scholarly discussion that are all too often dealt with separately
    in modern scholarship: the Islamization of the Near East and the place of
    women in pre-modern Near Eastern societies. It outlines how these two lines
    of inquiry can and should be read in an integrative manner. Major historical
    themes such as conversion to Islam, Islamization, religious violence, and
    the regulation of Muslim/non-Muslim ties are addressed and reframed by
    attending to the relatively hidden, yet highly meaningful, role that women
    played in these.This book is about the history of Islam from the perspective
    of female social agents. It argues that irrespective of their religious
    affiliation, women possessed crucial means for affecting or hindering
    religious changes, not only in the form of religious conversion, but also in
    the adoption of practices and the delineation of communal boundaries. Its
    focus on the role and significance of female power in moments of religious
    change within family households offers a historical angle that has hitherto
    been relatively absent from modern scholarship. Rather than locating signs
    of female autonomy or authority in the political, intellectual, religious,
    or economic spheres, Female Power and Religious Change in the Medieval Near
    East is concerned with the capacity of women to affect religious communal
    affiliations thanks to their kinship ties.

  abstract: >-
    Warum radikalisieren sich Individuen? Dieser Report gibt einen
    systematischen Überblick über den Forschungsstand zu den Ursachen und Folgen
    der Radikalisierung von Individuen und beschreibt wie diese in
    Wechselwirkung und Interaktion mit anderen Personen, sozialen Gruppen sowie
    Organisationen oder Institutionen stattfinden. Die Aneignung extremistischer
    Denkmuster sowie die Zugehörigkeit zu einer extremistischen
    Gleichaltrigengruppe im Jugendalter helfen bei der Befriedigung allgemeiner
    Bedürfnisse wie Anerkennung und Gruppenzugehörigkeit, aber auch bei der
    Reduktion von Unsicherheiten und Identitätskonflikten. Ideologien bieten
    Individuen nachvollziehbare Deutungsmuster und individuelle
    Handlungsalternativen für spezifische Problemlagen an. Der Report leitet aus
    seinen Erkenntnissen Vorschläge für zukünftige präventive und therapeutische
    Maßnahmen ab

  abstract: >-
    The High Middle Ages in Islamic Spain (al-Andalus) is often described as a
    golden age in which Jews, Christians and Muslims lived in harmony. The
    attested dynamics of conversions to Islam disturb this idyllic, static
    picture, revealing the religious and social pressures exerted on the
    religious minorities. The different reactions of the Jewish and Christian
    communities of al-Andalus to these pressures allow us to refine our
    understanding of conversion in the Medieval Islamic world. A close
    examination of the Jewish family of Banū Ḥasday shows more nuances and
    ambivalence than ‘conversion’ normally suggests.

  abstract: >-
    The triad of Jews, Gentiles and Christians seems clearly arranged in the
    religious
     world of the Roman Empire. However, a closer look shows that this is too simple a
     model in that it neither does justice to the diverse descriptions of these groups
     or those of others, nor to their respective concepts of identity or the varying mechanisms
     of inclusions and exclusions. This volume illustrates this by way of interdisciplinary
     individual studies on Asia Minor, but also through conceptional considerations. In
     summary, the editors offer new terminology suggestions

    This book examines the religious lives of young adults growing up in
    inter-religious
     families in India. It explores complex questions of identity, social background, and
     religion in twenty-first-century India. The volume studies the religious commitments
     of young adults, analyses the identity formation process for a critical age group,
     and discusses the interpersonal dynamics within inter-religious families. Drawing
     on real life stories of mixed heritage - Hindu, Sikh, Muslim, Christian, Jain, Buddhist,
     and Parsi - this volume will be of great interest to scholars and researchers of psychology,
     education, sociology and social anthropology, religious studies, politics, and other
     interdisciplinary studies

  abstract: >-
    Originally published in 1990, this book focuses on the challenge to Jewish
    identity posed by the conflicting forces of enlightenment, emancipation,
    modern political antisemitism, and secular ideologies like Zionism,
    nationalism, and socialism. At the heart of his discussion stands the
    intense, tortured, and ultimately tragic encounter of Jews with Germans and
    Austrians. He also deals at length with the new problems of Jewish cultural
    and political identity posed by the existence of the state of Israel and its
    embattled position among the nations. In the course of the analysis the book
    looks at the tragedy of assimilation in central Europe, with the optimistic
    dream of Enlightenment and Bildung coming to a climax in the nightmare of
    racial antisemitism and the Holocaust. He explores the ambivalent
    relationship of the Jews with the European Left, showing how many Jewish
    intellectuals found a new political home in radical and socialist movements,
    though these movements often retained negative stereotypes of Jews and
    Judaism and exhibited a fierce opposition to the maintenance of any separate
    Jewish identity. The role of Zionism is discussed and the more recent
    challenges to its legitimacy examined.
